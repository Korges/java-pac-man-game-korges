# Pac-Man Game

This is my own implementation of retro game - Pac-Man. I made it with my 3 person Team called BRICK.

Game touches such elements as:
* Networking
* Multi-threading
* JavaFX
* Serialization

Game is designed for two people. One person is Server, another is Client.  
The goal of Pac-Man is to collect all the coins, Ghost is to catch Pac-Man.
